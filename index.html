            <h2 class="card-title">C++</h2>
            <img src="img/cplusplus.png" alt="C++">
            <p class="card-text">A successor to C, the idea behind C++’s development was to add higher-level paradigms
              to C but also keeping
              the low-level qualities present in it. Since its inception, C++ has evolved quite a lot to include
              object-oriented, generic, and functional features. C++ is a compiled language that has many compilers to
              work
              on many different platforms, thus extending its usability.</p>
            <p class="card-text">Given its predecessor, C++ boasts notable computing performance, which is the reason
              why it’s mostly used for
              system programming and embedded systems. Thus, it’s often used to create device drivers, game engines,
              image
              and audio software, telecommunications networks, and interpreters. </p>

          <div class="card-body">
            <h2 class="card-title">C#</h2>
            <img src="img/csharp.png" alt="C#">
            <p class="card-text">Just Like C++, C# is another programming language built on top of C where the major
              addition was
              object-oriented capabilities. C# is closely related to Microsoft’s .NET framework since it was initially
              developed by the Redmond giant as part of its .NET initiative and has now become the primary language for
              .NET
              programming.</p>
            <p class="card-text">C# is another language that can be used to build close to everything you can think of
              but it’s perfectly
              suited to build Windows desktop applications and games. Additionally, you can use it to create web apps as
              well as mobile applications which can later be used on virtually any mobile device through cross-platform
              tools like Xamarin.</p>

          <div class="card-body">
            <h2 class="card-title">Ruby</h2>
            <img src="img/ruby.png" alt="Ruby">
            <p class="card-text">According to its own official website, “Ruby is a language of careful balance”. They
              can certainly claim that
              since the language combines parts of Perl, Smalltalk, Eiffel, Ada, and Lisp to come up with a balanced mix
              between functional and imperative programming. This interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming
              language is highly flexible since developers can remove or redefine any part of Ruby.</p>
            <p class="card-text">Ruby is mostly used for web application development, especially because of Ruby on
              Rails, a very popular
              development framework that provides an MVC (Model View Controller) architecture and encourages the use of
              web
              standards. Ruby’s uses don’t end there, though, as it can also be used for data analysis, prototyping, and
              proof of concepts.</p>

            <img src="img/python.png" alt="Python">
            <h2 class="card-title">Python</h2>
            <p class="card-text">A lot of beginners that have gone online to ask which programming language should they
              learn first hear
              Python as the first answer. That’s because the language has a strong emphasis on code readability, ease of
              use, and flexibility. All of that means that beginners can quickly learn it and start working on pretty
              much
              any application they can think of.</p>
            <p class="card-text">Though Python can be used to build everything from business applications to games,
              there are some strong
              suits for it. For one, the language is frequently used for data analysis, scripting, and scientific
              research,
              mainly because it includes a robust set of tools for that. But Python is also great for web app
              development
              and even for the creation of AI-based applications.</p>

          <div class="card-body">
            <h2 class="card-title">Java</h2>
            <img src="img/java.png" alt="Java">
            <p class="card-text">Java often appears at the top of programming languages rankings thanks to its huge
              popularity, rooted mainly
              in one thing: its “write once, run anywhere” (WORA) principle: any compiled Java code can run on any
              platform
              that supports Java without having to recompile it first. That’s possible thanks to the Java Runtime
              Environment (JRE), which runs on a Virtual Machine to provide it with that cross-platform capabilities.
            </p>
            <p class="card-text">Combined with the fact that Java is a general-purpose language, that makes it perfect
              for virtually any
              development project. In fact, Java is used for a lot of things, from Android apps and web apps to games,
              big
              data tools, and even scientific platforms.</p>

            <h2 class="card-title">Objective-C</h2>
            <img src="img/objective-c.png" class="card-img" alt="Objective-C">
            <p class="card-text">Yet another high-level programming language based on C, Objective-C took it a little
              further by adding
              features and syntax from Smalltalk. Thus, we can say it’s a superset of C since any C code can run
              perfectly in an Objective-C compiler. Objective-C was initially developed as a way to add object-oriented
              programming to C but has taken a life of its own by now.</p>
            <p class="card-text">Thanks to its capabilities, Objective-C was the main language for developing Mac OSX
              and iOS applications
              (in fact, you needed to learn it to create any apps for those systems). With the introduction of Swift by
              Apple, Objective-C isn’t the only alternative anymore, though it’s still an interesting option.</p>

            <h2 class="card-title">JavaScript</h2>
            <img src="img/javascript.png" alt="Javascript">
            <p class="card-text">JavaScript has been a fundamental part of our everyday lives for quite some time now,
              simply because it’s one
              of the essential pillars of most websites (along with HTML and CSS). Through JavaScript, web pages can
              dynamically apply changes to styles, animate menus, validate data entered into a form without refreshing,
              and
              much more. Javascript also works for web and mobile app development, as well as server applications and
              games.
            </p>
            <p class="card-text">Most modern websites use JavaScript in some sense or another to control client-side
              page behaviors. And
              though it’s mostly a programming language for front-end development, it can be used on the server side as
              well
              (with Node.js).</p>
